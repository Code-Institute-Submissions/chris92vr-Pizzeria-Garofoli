# Pizzeria Garofoli Website
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a responsive website for a traditional italian pizzeria. It's a front end site only and allows visitors to:
1.	Enter the atmosphere of the restaurant
2.	Reserve a table
3.	See the images in the gallery

## Demo

A demo of this site is available [here](https://chris92vr.github.io/Pizzeria-Garofoli).
 
## UX
 
This website is designed for people who want information about the pizzeria and in the event the possibility of being able to reserve a table. 
My goal in the design was to recall the italian tradition to be able to easily access the basic contact information of the restaurant.
The main purpose of the site is to provide users with the presentation of the pizzeria in order to obtain new possible customers.

## Features
Each page features a responsive header divided into three, colored to look like the Italian flag. On the left there is the name of the pizzeria, in the center an icon and on the right the navigation bar.
Each page has a footer with contact information and social media icons.

##### Homepage
Contains a bootstrap carousel showing the interior view of the restaurant, with a description and a button to reserve a table.  

##### Reservation
In this page there is a responsive form in which you can reserve a table. It has been realized  with the bootstrap’s class form-row.

##### Gallery
Contains grouped images sorted by using the bootstrap row class.

### Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to implement the gallery by adding interactivity with javascript.
